## Introduction

*Mecha Break*, released on **July 1 and 2, 2025** for **PC** and **Xbox Series X|S**, is a free‑to‑play hero shooter featuring giant combat mechs called **Strikers**, each tied to a distinct class role, fast paced battles, and a slick, colorful aesthetic. Developed by **Amazing Seasun Games**, it blends mech piloting thrills with accessible hero shooter mechanics, offering both **PvP** and **extraction‑style** modes for varied play.

## World and Story Setting

Set in a near‑future Earth, a virtual “Great Catastrophe” in **2082** revealed **Corite (EIC)**, a carbon‑silicon mineral that solved an energy crisis but caused environmental collapse. It spread **Fading Zones** across the planet, which only mechas can enter — piloted by third‑generation **BREAK Striker pilots** allied with a covert group known as **S.H.A.D.O.W.**

## Gameplay Modes

### PvP: 3v3 and 6v6 Hero Matches

Players engage in objective based matches like control points and payload pushes. Team coordination, role synergy, and ability timing are key to victory.

### Extraction Mode: *Mashmak (Operation Storm)*

In this PvPvE mode, squads battle AI enemies to collect loot and extract. Loot includes **Mod Boxes**, crafting materials, and **Matrix credits**. Mods offer temporary buffs with trade offs—such as increased energy regen at the cost of speed—tailored to each run.

## Combat System and Mechanics

![Mecha Break.](/images/mechabreak3.jpg)

Combat rewards smart **positioning, ability usage**, and **energy management**. Auto lock on aiming helps lower the mechanical skill barrier, making tactical play more important. Each **Striker** falls into a role—Attacker, Defender, Supporter, Sniper, Brawler—featuring **three abilities** and a **signature weapon**.

There's no skill tree, but Striker **mastery** grows through usage and experience with each class.

## Striker Roster and Roles

At launch, players can choose from **dozens of Strikers**, each with unique playstyles:

- **Attacker**: High DPS, harassment
- **Defender**: Tanky, control the battlefield
- **Supporter**: Healing, shields, utility
- **Sniper**: Long range precision
- **Brawler**: Disruptive melee combat

## Customization and Mods

### Cosmetics – Pilot and Mech Skins

Customization is cosmetic only: Striker skins, decals, insignias, and a deep **pilot avatar creator** (iris, height, hair, etc). These can be purchased with **Corite** or traded in the **Matrix Marketplace** as fixed presets.

### Mods (Mashmak Exclusive)

Each Striker has **five mod slots** for engine, cockpit, etc. Mods provide stat boosts with trade offs and are only active during Mashmak runs. Four rarity tiers: Fine (green), Superb (blue), Rare (purple), Flawless (gold). Fusion is possible to upgrade mods.

> Outside of Mashmak, no performance customization exists.

## Visuals, Audio and Immersion

Graphics are clean and colorful, with detailed mech models and dynamic effects. The soundtrack by **Hiroyuki Sawano** brings cinematic flair. However, voice acting and story content feel minimal or incomplete in beta stages.

## Economy and Monetization

While free to play, many cosmetics are locked behind premium **Corite currency**. The grind and currency systems can feel limiting, and the monetization may frustrate non paying players, especially with mod and cosmetic access.

## Post‑Launch Support and Updates

The devs are actively patching. A major **July 28, 2025** update introduced pilot **Lu Hui** with the **Stellaris MK III** and balance changes for 12 Strikers. New content and seasonal events are promised for future patches.
