## Building Your Own Meta Loadout

Consider:
- **Map & Range**: SMG‑45 for tight maps, Assault Riffle's or AWM for medium to long range.

- **Gadget Synergy**: HE Launcher (breaching), Smoke (support), Beacon (recon), etc.

## Why These Weapons Define the Meta

- **High DPS + Control**: Weapons like `AK-12`, `CI‑19`, and `SMG‑45` deliver balanced stats and high customization
- **Class Synergy**: LMGs for Engineers, Snipers for Recons, etc.
- **Utilities & Gadgets**: Weapon power is amplified by loadout synergy.

## Looking Ahead: Mid-Season & Beyond

## FAQ: Meta Loadouts & Season 5

### 1. What are the S+ weapons this season?
`SG552`, `CAR‑15`, `M4A1`, `CI‑19`, `AK-12`, `SMG‑45`, `QBJ201`

### 2. How to get the new KC‑17?
Rare **Operations-mode crate** drops; watch for mid-season unlock events

### 3. How does the Compound Bow fit into meta?
Great for **stealth or mid-range** play in Recon; unlocked via event missions

### 4. Is SMG‑45 still top-tier?
Yes, still **dominates CQB** scenarios with best-in-class control and fire rate

### 5. Best sniper and mid-range builds?
- `AWM` with suppressor + 6× for one-shot kills

### 6. Do attachments really matter?
Absolutely. Grips like `Bevel`, compensators like `Sandstorm`, and extended mags **greatly influence control and damage output**

### 7. Which operator is best suited for aggressive play in Season 5?
The new operator Tempest is ideal for aggressive players. Her enhanced sprint/swim speed, combat roll, and limited self-revive make her a top pick for fast-paced objective rushing and flanking.

### 8. What’s the best gadget combo for Recon players?
For stealth and information gathering, pair the SMG-45 or Compound Bow with a Recon Beacon and Smoke Grenades. This combo gives you map awareness and escape options in tight situations.

### 9. Are drum mags worth it for assault rifles?
Definitely. Drum mags like the 5.8 Drum allow you to take on multiple enemies without reloading, which is especially useful in Domination or Zone Capture modes where you’re frequently outnumbered.

### 10. Is the AWM still viable after recent patches?
Yes, the AWM remains the top-tier sniper in long-range combat. With a suppressor and 6x scope, it’s a one-shot kill to the head or upper chest, making it deadly in maps with long sightlines like Cyclone.
