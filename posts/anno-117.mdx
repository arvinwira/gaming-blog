### 1. Ancient Rome Setting
For the first time, *Anno* returns to a historical era—trading steampunk and industrial aesthetics for Roman architecture, civic governance, and political intrigue during the **Pax Romana**.

### 2. Dual Starting Provinces: Latium and Albion
Players can choose between:

- **the Roman province of Latium** – the lush heartland of Rome, ideal for classical city planning.  
- **the Celtic Profince of Albion** – the misty, rebellious Celtic frontier.

This choice affects early gameplay style and cultural influence dynamics.

### 3. Romanization vs. Celtic Traditions
Your governor’s decisions shape cultural evolution:
- Do you push **Romanization**—bringing togas and amphitheaters?
- Or preserve **Celtic traditions** with local crafts and rituals?

- **Resource chains** now affect nearby buildings—making spatial planning critical.

### 6. Land and Naval Combat

- For the first time in Anno: **tactical land battles** with field armies and skirmishes.

### 7. Deep Diplomacy & Faith System
Civil and religious decisions influence:
- Culture  
- Alliances  
- Regional loyalty
