## What Is Racing Master?

![Racing Master.](/images/racingmaster.jpg)

Racing Master is a free to play mobile racing simulation co developed by NetEase Games and Codemasters. It uses Codemasters’ EGO physics engine and Unreal Engine 4, bringing console‑level realism to Android and iOS. The project kicked off in 2021 and has seen multiple beta tests across China, Japan, Korea, Canada, and the US before launching in Southeast Asia in March 2025.


## Release Timeline & Availability

* First launched in China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan during 2023–2024, quickly topping app store charts.
* **Southeast Asia launch:** March 27, 2025, with pre registration open from late February.
* **Global launch:** Expected in the second half of 2025.


## Why Racing Master Stands Out

### Realism Engineered by Codemasters
Codemasters built the core physics system based on their EGO engine ensuring every Ferrari, Porsche, and Lamborghini behaves realistically on track.

### Stunning Graphics via Unreal Engine 4
From reflections on hood panels to realistic lighting and haptic engine feedback, Racing Master has been hailed as one of the most visually impressive mobile games ever made.

### Massive Licensed Car Roster
With over 100 licensed vehicles from manufacturers like Ferrari, Porsche, Koenigsegg, Aston Martin, Pagani, Nissan, and McLaren, players can build enviable collections.

### Iconic Tracks & Real City Environments
Race across famous circuits like Shanghai International Circuit and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and explore photorealistic city courses in San Francisco and Chicago.

### Deep Customization Options
Players can upgrade performance with parts like engine tuning, suspension, tires, and brakes, and customize aesthetics via color, decals, rims, and body. Designs can be shared via Studio.

### Competitive Multiplayer & Modes
With PvP real time races, ranked tournaments, time trials, story mode, license challenges, and club events—players can race solo or with teams to climb leaderboards.

### User Friendly Control & Accessibility
Offers tilt or touch controls with adjustable sensitivity and driving assist options like auto throttle and auto drift. Assist features can be disabled for full simulation control. Native gamepad support is also available.


## Gameplay Experience & Early User Feedback

### Visuals & Performance
> Reddit users called it “one of the best looking mobile games” with performance up to ultra settings at 60 fps even on high end phones, with zero heating and smooth playback.

### Controls & Immersive Feel
> The menus are sleek and polished remalling COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile UI while race physics mirror Grid’s feel. Controls react sharply, though some complain minor assistance elements persist even when disabled.

### Monetization & Progression
> The monetization model is considered balanced. Players earn cars and upgrades via races and missions, and microtransactions like Season Passes, but are considered optional. Premium cars are rare but reasonably obtainable without paying.
