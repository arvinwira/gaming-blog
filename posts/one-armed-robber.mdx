## What Is One‑armed Robber?

![One Armed Robber.](/images/onearmedrobber2.jpg)

**One‑armed Robber** is a chaotic, first-person co‑op heist game available for free on Steam. Developed with a unique and hilarious twist, the game challenges players to pull off elaborate robberies while only using **one arm**. That’s right, from the moment you spawn, you’ll find yourself fumbling with weapons, tools, and loot using just a single limb. It’s awkward, absurd, and endlessly entertaining.

This one-armed limitation isn’t just a gimmick, it’s core to the game’s charm and teamwork-focused design. When you play with a friend, you effectively gain back your second arm, making everything smoother (but not necessarily less chaotic).

You and your crew can plan the perfect stealth infiltration, picking locks, disabling cameras, sneaking past guards or go loud with guns blazing, cracking open vaults and shooting your way out. Each heist can play out differently depending on your strategy, your loadout, and how well you coordinate with your friends.

What makes it even more impressive is how lightweight the game is. At just **1 GB**, it’s incredibly fast to download and runs well on most machines, making it perfect for spontaneous play sessions with friends. Whether you're planning a flawless operation or just laughing at your teammate dropping the drill again, **One‑armed Robber** is built for good times and unpredictable moments.

If you’re looking for a game that blends action, comedy, and co-op madness in a small but mighty package, **One‑armed Robber** is definitely worth trying.

## Play With Friends: Co‑op Chaos

At the heart of **One‑armed Robber** is teamwork. Invite a friend and coordinate your approach. 

&nbsp;

**Stealth Approach:** Carefully scout the area for alternate entrances and use lockpicks to gain silent access. Keep a close eye on patrolling guards and surveillance cameras. Locate keycards to unlock restricted areas like utility rooms and vaults. Disable alarms and security systems to complete the heist without drawing any attention.

&nbsp;

**Loud Approach:** Storm the location with guns blazing and eliminate all guards standing in your way. Take out power boxes to disrupt systems, then force entry into the vault using drills or explosives. Expect heavy resistance and prepare for an intense shootout during your escape.

&nbsp;

Both approach have the same goal: **get in, grab the loot, and get out alive**.


## Customization & Loadouts

Despite its small size, **One‑armed Robber** offers impressive customization:

&nbsp;

- **Guns and attachments**: Unlock and buy weapons, then tailor them with options like suppressors for stealth or extended mags for loud approaches.

&nbsp;

- **Tools**: As you progress, unlock tools that can help make your heist easier like advanced lock pics, better drills and even camera blockers.

&nbsp;

- **Cosmetics**: Outfits, masks, and emotes come in **rare, epic, and legendary tiers**, purchaseable via in-game coins or real currency.
