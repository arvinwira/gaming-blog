Imagine a world ravaged by disaster where even a simple package delivery becomes a matter of survival. That is the premise of *PACS: Post Apocalypse Courier Service*, an upcoming cooperative courier game from indie developer Studio 316. Described as a blend of *MudRunner*, *Euro Truck Simulator 2*, and *Mad Max*, *PACS* lets players build and drive delivery trucks across a brutal, desolate landscape. It has even been likened to the co-op survival game *Lethal Company*, hinting at tense team based gameplay. During its Steam announcement, a gameplay trailer showcased the core vision and drew in thousands of wishlists in just a few days. This unique blend of simulation and survival elements is likely what draws attention, appealing to fans of both genres.

&nbsp;

At its core, *PACS* puts you in charge of a struggling delivery company trying to survive in this harsh environment. The goal is to grow your operation from a small garage into the best courier business in the wasteland. To succeed, you must navigate treacherous roads and extreme weather, scavenging parts to keep your trucks running and carefully managing each delivery. The game supports solo play, but it truly shines with friends: up to four players can team up to tackle deliveries together.

## Gameplay Overview

*PACS* revolves around running a post apocalyptic delivery service and offers a mix of driving, strategy, and resource management. Here are the key gameplay elements known so far:

* **Core gameplay loop (Early Access):** According to the developers, even the initial build of *PACS* includes the core loop of the delivery service. Players can already sort parcels, upgrade their truck, and navigate dangerous terrain, with support for up to four players. These fundamentals are in place as the studio adds more content.

* **Cooperative multiplayer:** Team up with up to four players in shared delivery missions across the wasteland. Friends can coordinate routes and repairs to maximize efficiency.

* **Vehicle building and customization:** Players start with basic trucks and can upgrade every part. You will scavenge for parts (tires, engines, suspension, etc.) and use them to repair and improve your vehicles.

* **Delivery missions and progression:** Each run begins by sorting and packing parcels into your truck. You must choose which deliveries to make based on package size and priority. Successfully completing missions earns you reputation and money, allowing you to expand from that small garage into a nationwide courier company (as described by the developers).

* **Resource and inventory management:** The wasteland is dangerous. The game features dynamic weather and hazards, so you might find yourself scavenging for spare tires or truck parts along the way. Efficiently managing your load and supplies is key to long trips.

* **Diverse environments:** *PACS* takes place in a visually varied post apocalypse. Players will traverse icy mountain peaks, sandy deserts, and muddy swamps, along with abandoned city ruins. Preview materials describe the terrain as “treacherous” and “desolate yet beautifully diverse,” promising a mix of scenery and challenges.

Overall, *PACS* mixes the slow paced planning of a driving sim with the challenge of survival. You’ll spend much of your time repairing vehicles and planning routes, making each journey both calm and exciting.

## Story and Setting

&nbsp;

*PACS* does not center on a detailed narrative or characters; instead, its setting is the star. The game takes place after an unspecified apocalypse, with society in ruins. According to press materials, the landscape is a "desolate wasteland" that is also "beautifully diverse." You drive past ruined infrastructure and natural hazards as you deliver packages. The implied backstory is that civilization collapsed and now couriers like you are essential for connecting the few remaining survivors.

&nbsp;

There is currently no deeper plot revealed. The focus is on atmosphere and emergent gameplay. Developers describe the goal as growing your business and “becoming the best in the wasteland,” so any story emerges from your own actions delivering cargo, scavenging for parts, and overcoming challenges. In this sense, *PACS* tells its story through gameplay rather than through cutscenes or characters.

## Studio 316 and Development

*PACS* is being developed by Studio 316, a small UK indie studio based in Cornwall. The team was founded in 2021. One announcement even tagged *PACS* as '*MudRunner* meets *Lethal Company* meets *Mad Max*', highlighting its blend of survival and driving influences.

&nbsp;

At the moment, *PACS* has a live Steam page but no confirmed release date. It is planned for Early Access, meaning the game will launch as a work in progress and be expanded over time. The developers estimate an 18 to 24 month Early Access period during which player feedback will shape new features. They also plan to continuously add more content, such as additional delivery missions, new vehicles, and expanded environments. For now, fans can add *PACS* to their Steam wishlist to receive updates.

## Conclusion

*PACS: Post Apocalypse Courier Service* stands out as a novel blend of genres. By combining realistic driving simulation with inventory management and cooperative survival, it offers something different from typical racing or adventure games. For fans of *MudRunner*, *Euro Truck Simulator*, or cooperative survival titles like *Lethal Company*, *PACS* provides a fresh challenge. In fact, the Steam store tags for *PACS* include "Survival", "Driving", and "Co-op", reflecting how it spans multiple categories of gameplay.

&nbsp;

As an editor who enjoys creative indie games, I find *PACS* intriguing. Its mix of slow paced strategy and cooperative action could make for a relaxing yet engaging experience. If it delivers on its promise, it could carve out a niche. For now, *PACS* is already a promising indie title. Only time will reveal if Studio 316 can fully deliver on this ambitious concept.
