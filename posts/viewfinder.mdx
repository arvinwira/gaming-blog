**Viewfinder** is a first person puzzle game released on July 18, 2023 for PC and PlayStation 5 (and later PlayStation 4 on December 12, 2023). Created by indie studio Sad Owl Studios (formerly Robot Turtle) and published by Thunderful Publishing, the game invites players into a simulation where photographs and artwork literally reshape the environment. With its creative mechanics, striking art style, and environmental themes, Viewfinder offers both gamers and general readers an engaging experience that challenges perception, puzzles, and storytelling.


## Gameplay Overview

Viewfinder’s core mechanic hinges on the **"Polaroid effect"**. The player uses a Polaroid style camera to snap images in game. When these pictures are placed onto surfaces, they become **3D structures or terrain** derived from the original snapshot. Initially you place bridges or battery icons to progress, but quickly puzzles escalate photograph images created by earlier snapshots, stack them, angle them creatively to cross chasms, activate teleporters and solve spatial riddles.

&nbsp; 

Levels remain discrete but clever, each ending at a teleporter. Some puzzles require power items like batteries, which you copy or manipulate via placed photos. The pacing introduces new mechanics gradually and remains approachable while rewarding exploration and lateral thinking.

&nbsp; 

Critics across outlets praised the intuitive yet mind bending mechanic as an evolution of Portal style spatial puzzles, calling it one of the most inventive puzzle games in years.


## Story and Setting

After causing a simulated error, you are briefly freed into a distant future world with red tinged dust skies, revealing the climate scarred reality you hope to heal.

Though reviewers note that the story is relatively **thin and feels underexplored**, it ties neatly into the gameplay and atmosphere. A final revelation about a seedling found upon exit helps close the loop with hope for Earth’s future.


## Graphics and Sound

Each placed photo retains its original style, leading to **stunning visual contrasts and impossible geometry**. Many reviewers compared the art direction to a combination of Renaissance painting and modern abstract styles like Portal through a painter’s lens.
