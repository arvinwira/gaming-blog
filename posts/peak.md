Combining physics-based gameplay with a cooperative roguelike structure, PEAK is shaping up to be one of the most viral indie co-op games on Steam.

## What is PEAK? Landfall’s Next Big Multiplayer Adventure

PEAK is a 1-4 player cooperative roguelike climbing game where you and your friends take on the role of contractors hired by a giant company called GalactiCo. Your mission: climb hazardous, procedurally generated mountains to retrieve valuable loot scattered across the peaks.

But this isn’t a serene hiking simulator. True to Landfall’s style, PEAK features deliberately awkward, physics-driven movement that makes every jump, swing, and slip a hilarious spectacle. Whether you’re executing a flawless human chain across a gap or accidentally launching your teammate into the abyss, the game guarantees moments you’ll want to clip and share.

## Key Features of PEAK

**Physics-Based Climbing**

Movement in PEAK is entirely physics-driven, much like Landfall’s previous titles. Your character’s weight, momentum, and grip all matter, creating a climbing experience that feels both satisfying and chaotically unpredictable. Expect your biggest obstacles to often be your own teammates — or yourself.

**Procedurally Generated Mountains**

Every run is different thanks to procedural generation. Each climb offers a new layout, with randomized terrain, loot placements, and hazards like icy slopes or narrow cliff faces. This roguelike approach means no two ascents are ever the same, keeping gameplay fresh and challenging.

**Gadgets, Gear & Customization**

From grappling hooks and ropes to rocket boosters and deployable trampolines (yes, really), PEAK is loaded with equipment that can either save your climb or turn it into a spectacular disaster. Players can also customize their climbers with unique outfits, hats, and accessories to show off their corporate style.

**Built for Co-op**

PEAK is designed with cooperative multiplayer at its core. While you can tackle mountains alone, the game truly shines when you’re coordinating (or failing to coordinate) with friends. Expect moments of improvised teamwork — and plenty of good-natured shouting when things go wrong.

## Why PEAK is a Must-Play Co-op Game
PEAK stands out by blending the replayability of a roguelike with the joyful unpredictability of a physics sandbox. It’s not trying to be a hyper-realistic climbing simulator; instead, it’s a colorful, laughter-filled playground where the real reward is the stories you create with friends. Whether you’re carefully coordinating a four-person grapple swing across a canyon or accidentally turning a teammate into a human trampoline, PEAK is all about creating those watercooler moments that make multiplayer gaming unforgettable.

## Final Thoughts: Is PEAK Worth Trying?
If you enjoy games like Human: Fall Flat, Gang Beasts, or Landfall’s own TABS, PEAK is almost certainly going to be your next multiplayer obsession. Its combination of physics-based comedy, roguelike variety, and cooperative chaos is a proven recipe for countless game nights.
